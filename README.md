Here I chalanged my self to recreate a ant simulator in C using 42's mlx.

it came out better then expected and I even added in a way to change the settings live!

if the minilibx-linix does not have files get them from here https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux.git

to compile run "make". for linux do "make linux"

then to run do "./ant <num of ants>"
